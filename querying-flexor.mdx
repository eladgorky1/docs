## Querying best-practices

Live FLEX querying is typically used for **data exploration** or **input tuning**. In the structured data space, the most efficient way to explore data and iterate on metric calculations is **to compare experiments against each other**. Working against a reference lets data practitioners quantify improvements, make trade-offs, and align the analysis with business objectives.\
\
In the unstructured data space, **we do this by running two parallel FLEX queries**. Differences between inputs surface immediately, and the iteration process becomes easy, reliable, and consistent - results are always compared against a reference rather than analyzed in isolation.

```sql lines
USE SCHEMA FLEXOR.YOUR_ENVIRONMENT_NAME;

CREATE OR REPLACE TEMP TABLE relevant_subset AS
(   
    SELECT        
			*,        
			CASE WHEN COUNT(*) OVER() > 5000 THEN 1/0 ELSE 1 END as row_check,
    FROM ( 
			-- USER: Refine this subset until you fit the 5,000 rows query limit
			SELECT *
	        FROM YOUR_DATASET_NAME -- USER: Insert the desired dataset
    	    WHERE timestamp >= '2026-01-01' -- USER: Filter relevant data
        	ORDER BY timestamp -- USER: Ensure correct ordering to minimize cuts (usually, by timestamp or ordering_index)
        )
);

-- Using double-FLEX for quick comparisons

SELECT 
	-- USER: Use ENTRY_ID for Flexor-Document-Schema datasetes
	-- USER: Use MESSAGE_ID for Flexor-Conversational-Schema datasetes 
    ENTRY_ID, CONTENT, 
    TRY_PARSE_JSON(column_1:answer) as answer_column_1,
    TRY_PARSE_JSON(column_2:answer) as answer_column_2,
    column_1:evidence as evidence_column_1,
    column_2:evidence as evidence_column_2,
    column_1:viewer::text as vw_fcolumn_1,
    column_2:viewer::text as vw_fcolumn_2
FROM (
    SELECT 
		-- USER: Use ENTRY_ID / MESSAGE_ID
        FLEX(ENTRY_ID, 'Is there a name?') as column_1,
        FLEX(ENTRY_ID, 'Is there a full name?') as column_2,
		*
    FROM relevant_subset
) 

-- USER: View desired results. Typically, true / false / not like '%NA%'
WHERE answer_column_1 not like '%false%';
