## Prerequisite

- A user with _ACCOUNTADMIN_ (aka Account Administrator) or _ORGADMIN_ (aka Organization Administrator) permissions.

## Step-by-Step

### 1. Create the Source Table

Create the table you'll share with Flexor. Enable change tracking so we can efficiently detect and process only new or modified rows rather than rescanning the full table.

```sql
CREATE TABLE <database>.<schema>.<table_name> (
  <table_definition>
) CHANGE_TRACKING = TRUE;
```

### 2. Verify Schema

[Data Types & Schemas](https://flexor.mintlify.app/overview).

### 3. Create and Configure the Share

Execute the subsequent query, specifying the following parameters:

| Parameter      | Description                                            |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| database_name  | The database you want to share                         |
| schema_name    | The schema you want to share                           |
| table_name     | The table that you want to share                       |
| flexor_account | Account identifier given by Flexor for the integration |

```sql
create share share_to_flexor;
grant usage on database <database_name> to share share_to_flexor;
grant usage on schema <schema_name> to share share_to_flexor;
use database <database_name>;
use schema <schema_name>;
grant select on table <schema_name>.<table_name> to share share_to_flexor;
alter share share_to_flexor add accounts = <flexor_account>;
```

> **Note:** The actions described above grant Flexor access exclusively to the specified `<table_name>`, without providing access to any other resources.
