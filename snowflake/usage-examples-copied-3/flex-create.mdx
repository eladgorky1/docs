# Use FLEX_CREATE with Azure Fabric

This page describes how to use the `FLEX_CREATE` function in Azure Fabric.

## Examples

### Classification

```sql
%%sql
SELECT FLEX_CREATE(
    'Did the customer request a refund?',
    'refund_request',
    'conversations'
);
```

### Extraction

```sql
%%sql
SELECT FLEX_CREATE(
    'Did the customer mention a product issue? -> product',
    'issue_product',
    'conversations'
);
```

### Coupled-extraction

```sql
%%sql
SELECT FLEX_CREATE(
    'Did the customer complain? -> product AS product, issue AS issue',
    'product_issues',
    'conversations'
);
```

### Categories

```sql
%%sql
SELECT FLEX_CREATE(
    'Did the customer report an issue? -> issue type -> [Billing, Technical, Shipping, Account]',
    'issue_category',
    'conversations'
);
```

## Filter Results

Use `IS NOT NULL` and string comparison to filter out empty and `NA` results:

```sql
%%sql
SELECT <column_name>
FROM <dataset_name>.<table_name>
WHERE <column_name> IS NOT NULL
    AND <column_name> <> '["NA"]';
```

## Unnested View

Flexor provides an unnested view for Extraction and Category columns where each value is displayed in a separate row.

```sql
%%sql
SELECT *
FROM <table_name>_unnested
WHERE column_name LIKE '<column_name>';
```
