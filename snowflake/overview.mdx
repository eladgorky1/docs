Flexor integrates natively with Snowflake, enabling you to analyze all your unstructured data in the environment you already know, with the SQL syntax you're familiar with, and seamlessly connected to all your structured data.

## How It Works

Flexor runs directly inside your Snowflake environment. You query your data using familiar SQL syntax, and Flexor processes it in place—classifying text, extracting entities, and categorizing content at scale.

```sql
SELECT FLEX(message_id, 'Did the customer request a refund?') as flex
FROM support_tickets
```

No data pipelines to build. No external API calls to manage. Your data stays in Snowflake, and Flexor delivers structured insights alongside your existing tables.
