# Data Types & Schemas

Flexor ingests unstructured data from across your enterprise and transforms it into structured, AI-compatible outputs. This section defines the **required schemas** for each supported data type - the structure Flexor expects when you send data for processing.

## How Schemas Work

Each data type has a defined schema that tells Flexor:

- **What fields to expect** - Required and optional columns for your data
- **How to identify records** - Unique identifiers that link back to your source systems
- **How to reconstruct context** - Timestamps, relationships, and metadata that preserve meaning

When your data matches the expected schema, Flexor can accurately unify, normalize, and enrich it - delivering consistent, trustworthy outputs every time.

## Supported Data Types

Flexor supports a wide range of unstructured enterprise data:
