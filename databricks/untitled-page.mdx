title: "Importing Flexor Functions"
---

## Overview

To integrate Flexor's SQL functions into Databricks, Flexor uses UDFs (user-defined functions). You must import the Flexor library each time you start working on a new Databricks notebook or after the cluster restarts. This ensures that the required dependencies and configurations are properly loaded.

Once you import the Flexor library, all Flexor functions will be available for use.

## Import Library

Run the following command in a Python cell at the beginning of your notebook:

```python
import flexor
flexor.init("flexor_secrets")
```

## When to Initialize

You should execute this initialization step in the following scenarios:

| Scenario                                | Description                                                                                              |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **First-time use in a new notebook**    | Each new Databricks notebook session requires initialization                                             |
| **After restarting the cluster**        | Cluster restarts clear loaded libraries, so reinitialization is necessary                                |
| **When encountering dependency errors** | If you see `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'flexor'`, re-running the initialization may resolve it |
