This page describes how to use the `FLEX_ARCHIVE` function in Databricks to remove persistent columns and disable their recurring pipelines.

## Example

### Archive a column

```sql
%sql
SELECT FLEX_ARCHIVE('refund_request', 'support_tickets');
```

This removes both columns from your output table:

- `refund_request`
- `refund_request_evidence`
