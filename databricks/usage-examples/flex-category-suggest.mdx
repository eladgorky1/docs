This page describes how to use the `FLEX_CATEGORY_SUGGEST` function in Databricks to get category recommendations based on your data.

## Example

If you have at least 10 `"Other"` results, run:

```sql
%sql
SELECT * FROM FLEX_CATEGORY_SUGGEST(
    'Did the customer report an issue? -> issue type -> [Billing, Technical]',
    'issue_category',
    'support_tickets'
);
```

**Sample output:**

```json
["Tablet", "Headphones", "Camera"]
```
