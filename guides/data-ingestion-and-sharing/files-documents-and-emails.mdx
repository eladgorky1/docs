## Folder & File Structure Requirements

To ingest data into Flexor's recurring pipeline, please structure your files as follows:

### 1. Organize data by namespace

- Create a separate folder for each data namespace.
- The folder name will determine the target Flexor table name. Example\_:\_ Place CRM notes data in a folder named `crm_notes`. This will map to the `crm_notes` table.

### 

### 2. Hive style partitioning

- Inside each namespace folder, create a subfolder for every batch of data using an ISO 8601 timestamp. Example: `crm_notes/timestamp=2024-07-17T15:30:00Z/...files`

### 3. Supported file formats

- Please ensure that the file in each batch directory is in **Parquet** format.
