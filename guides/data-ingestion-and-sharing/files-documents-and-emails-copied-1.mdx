## Folder & File Structure Requirements

To ingest data into Flexor's recurring pipeline, please structure your files as follows:

### 1. Organize data by namespace

- Create a separate folder for each data namespace.
- The folder name will determine the target Flexor table name. Example: Place legal-related documents in a folder named `legal_documents`. This will map to the `legal_documents` table.

### 2. Create a timestamped folder on each write operation

- Inside each namespace folder, create a subfolder for every batch of data using an ISO 8601 timestamp.
- _Example:_ `legal_documents/timestamp=2024-07-17T15:30:00Z/...files`

### 3. Use unique file names

- **Flexor assumes file names are unique and are used as identifiers**
- Each file must have a unique file name.
- This file name will be used as the `joinable_id` in your final Flexor table.
- Our system uses this ID to deduplicate records (duplicates with the same `joinable_id` are dropped).

### 4. Supported file formats

Please ensure that files in each batch directory are in one of the following formats:

- **Compressed formats:** ZIP (incl. multi-part)
- **Email formats:** HTML, EML, MSG, MBOX, PST
- **Document formats:** PDF, DOCX
