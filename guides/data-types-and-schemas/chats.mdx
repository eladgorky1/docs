# Required Ingested Schema

## Priority 1 – Message-Level Schema

We strongly recommend sending transcripts data at the message level. This provides the highest fidelity and enables Flexor to accurately reconstruct conversations, ordering, and speaker roles.

| Field           | Description                                                                                                                                 |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| joinable_id     | Unique message identifier, used to join back to other structured data                                                                       |
| conversation_id | Identifier for the entire transcript that includes this message                                                                             |
| timestamp       | When the sentence was said (ISO 8601 format)                                                                                                |
| content         | Text content of the specific sentence                                                                                                       |
| sender          | Name of the speaker                                                                                                                         |
| ordering_index  | _(Optional)_ Sentence ordering index within the transcript (starting from 0)                                                                |
| sender_type     | _(Optional)_ Defines the speaker's role within the conversation. Accepted values are `User` for end-customers and `Agent` for support staff |

## Priority 2 – Conversation-Level Schema

If message-level data is not available, conversation-level data may be provided. In this case, additional per-message metadata is mandatory.

| Field       | Description                                                                      |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| joinable_id | Unique identifier for the transcript, used to join back to other structured data |
| timestamp   | When the call was initiated (ISO 8601 format)                                    |
| content     | Text content of the entire transcript                                            |

### Mandatory additional requirements for conversation-level data

For each message within the transcript, we must be able to identify:

- Speaker's name of each sentence
- Speaker type (`User`/`Agent` or `External`/`Internal`)
- Sentence-level timestamp

**Example:**

```json
[
  {
    "text": "Hi there, I'm having trouble logging into my account",
    "speaker_name": "Jordan Lee",
    "speaker_affiliation": "user",
    "start": "2025-05-27 18:09:12.000"
  },
  {
    "text": "Hey Jordan! I can help with that. Are you seeing an error message or just being redirected back to the login screen?",
    "speaker_name": "Emily Carter",
    "speaker_affiliation": "agent",
    "start": "2025-05-27 18:09:18.420"
  }
]
```
