# Required Schema

## Priority 1 – Message-Level Schema

We strongly recommend sending support tickets data at the message level. This provides the highest fidelity and enables Flexor to accurately reconstruct conversations, ordering, and speaker roles.

| Field           | Description                                                                                                                                |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| joinable_id     | Unique ticket/comment identifier, used to join back to other structured data                                                               |
| conversation_id | Identifier for the entire conversation that includes this message                                                                          |
| timestamp       | When the ticket/comment was sent (ISO 8601 format)                                                                                         |
| content         | Text content of the ticket/comment                                                                                                         |
| sender          | Name of the ticket/comment sender                                                                                                          |
| subject         | Subject of the ticket                                                                                                                      |
| ordering_index  | _(Optional)_ Comment ordering index within the conversation (starting from 0)                                                              |
| sender_type     | _(Optional)_ Defines the sender's role within the conversation. Accepted values are `User` for end-customers and `Agent` for support staff |

## Priority 2 – Conversation-Level Schema

If message-level data is not available, conversation-level data may be provided. In this case, additional per-message metadata is mandatory.

| Field       | Description                                                                  |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| joinable_id | Unique identifier for the ticket, used to join back to other structured data |
| timestamp   | When the ticket was opened (ISO 8601 format)                                 |
| content     | Text content of the tickets, including the comments                          |
| subject     | _(Optional)_ Subject of the ticket                                           |

### Mandatory additional requirements for conversation-level data

For each comment, we must be able to identify:

- Sender name
- Comment-level timestamp
- Subject of each comment (if not provided in the main schema)

**Example:**

```json
[
  {
    "subject": "Unable to log into account",
    "from": "jordan.lee@customerco.com",
    "date": "2025-05-27 18:09:12.000",
    "text": "Hi there, I'm having trouble logging into my account. I keep getting an invalid credentials error."
  },
  {
    "subject": "Re: Unable to log into account",
    "from": "emily.carter@company.com",
    "date": "2025-05-27 18:16:45.380",
    "text": "Hi Jordan! Happy to help. Can you let me know if you've already tried resetting your password?"
  }
]
```
