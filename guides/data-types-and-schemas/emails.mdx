Subject: Issue logging into my account

Hi Support Team,
I'm having trouble logging into my account this morning.
I keep getting an "Invalid credentials" error, even though I'm confident my password is correct.
Could you please help me look into this?

Thanks,
Jordan Lee

Hi Jordan,

Thanks for reaching out -- happy to help.
Can you please confirm whether you've tried resetting your password, and if so, whether the issue still persists afterward?

If possible, also let me know which browser you're using.

Best regards,
