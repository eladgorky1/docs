title: "Domain Intelligence"

Domain Intelligence is Flexor's understanding of your organization's unique business language - the terminology, entities, and context that make your data meaningful.

## Overview

Every organization has its own language: product names, internal acronyms, industry jargon, competitor references, and business-specific terms that carry meaning only within your context. General AI models don't understand this language - they lack awareness of what "Project Aurora" means at your company, that "Bridge" is your integration feature, or that "USD" might mean a file format rather than currency in your industry.

Domain Intelligence bridges this gap. Flexor automatically learns and applies your unique business vocabulary to improve the quality of every transformation - ensuring that all the Flexor and your AI results reflect what terms actually mean in your world.

## Why Domain Intelligence Matters

Without domain context, AI makes mistakes:

| Scenario                               | Without Domain Intelligence      | With Domain Intelligence                            |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Customer mentions "NexGen"             | Generic text, no special meaning | Recognized as an integration partner                |
| Support ticket says "issue with Pulse" | Unknown term                     | Understood as a feature                             |
| Sales note says "lost to Acme Corp"    | Company name extracted           | Identified as a competitor                          |
| Agent writes "escalate to Tiger Team"  | Confusing, unknown reference     | Understood as your critical incident response group |

Domain Intelligence transforms ambiguous text into precise, business-aware insights.

## What Domain Intelligence Includes

Flexor builds a comprehensive understanding of your business language as:

**Business Relationship Entities** Organizations and individuals with specific relationships to your company - customers, competitors, partners, vendors, and integration products. Understanding these relationships changes how Flexor interprets mentions in your data.

**Products & Features** Your product names, feature names, and internal brand names. These terms carry a specific meaning that generic models miss.

**Organizational Terms** Team names, department names, internal process names, and role-specific terminology unique to your company structure.

**Industry-Specific Terms** Terminology with specialized meaning in your industry. "Queen" means something specific in the mattress industry. "USD" can be a file format in 3D software. Flexor learns these distinctions.

**Acronyms & Aliases** Internal abbreviations, shorthand, and alternative names that your teams use daily but wouldn't appear in any external dictionary.

## How Domain Intelligence Works

Flexor builds your Domain Intelligence from multiple sources:

| Source                     | Description                                                                                          |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Your unstructured data** | Flexor analyzes your processed unstructured data to discover domain terms in context                 |
| **Company websites**       | Your website and product pages provide official terminology                                          |
| **Customer documentation** | Internal guides, knowledge bases, and training materials contain business-specific language _(Soon)_ |
| **Manual additions**       | Add terms that don't appear in your data but are critical to your business                           |

Domain Intelligence is maintained per data namespace, so different business units or product lines can have distinct terminology that reflects their specific context.

## Example

A technology company uses Flexor to analyze support tickets. Their Domain Intelligence includes:

| Term         | Type        | Definition                             | Synonyms                      |
| ------------ | ----------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| CloudSync    | Product     | Real-time data synchronization product | CS, Cloud Sync, the sync tool |
| Databricks   | Integration | Supported data platform integration    | DBX                           |
| Snowflake    | Integration | Supported data warehouse integration   | SF, Snowflake DWH             |
| DataFlow Inc | Competitor  | Competing ETL platform                 | DataFlow, DFI                 |

When a support ticket says "Customer wants to connect CS to SF but is considering switching to DataFlow," Flexor understands:

- "CS" → CloudSync (their product)
- "SF" → Snowflake (an integration)
- "DataFlow" → DataFlow Inc (a competitor)

This domain context enables accurate reasoning of what the customer actually means, turning ambiguous abbreviations and product names into precise, actionable outputs.
