title: "Context"
---

Context is the surrounding information from a conversation or document that Flexor uses to understand the full meaning of each message or element.

## Overview

A single message or text element rarely tells the complete story. When a customer writes "Yes, I want to cancel," what are they canceling? When an email says "Please see the attached report," what does that report contain? The meaning lives in the surrounding context - previous messages, earlier paragraphs, attachments, and the flow of the conversation.

Flexor automatically captures and applies the relevant context needed to understand each piece of text, ensuring that every transforamtion reflects the true meaning - not just the words in isolation.

## Why Context Matters

Without context, AI interprets text in a vacuum and makes mistakes:

| Message in Isolation     | What It Seems to Mean  | What It Actually Means (with Context)                            |
| :----------------------- | :--------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Yes, go ahead"          | Agreement to something | Approval to process a refund (from previous messages)            |
| "Can you send it again?" | Resend request         | Asking for a revised version of a proposal discussed earlier     |
| "The numbers look off"   | Vague concern          | Specific issue with Q3 projections mentioned in the attached PDF |

Context transforms ambiguous statements into precise, actionable insights.

## The Problem with Single Messages or Elements

Analyzing individual messages or document sections without context creates significant issues:

**Lost References** Messages often refer to things mentioned earlier. "It" and "that" and "the issue" only make sense when you know what came before.

**Missing Intent** A customer's true intent often builds across multiple exchanges. The final message might be a simple "Yes" - but understanding what they're agreeing to requires the full conversation.

**Incomplete Understanding** Documents reference other sections, attachments, and prior communications. A paragraph in isolation may be meaningless without the preceding context.

**False Classifications** Without context, a message like "I'm done" could be classified as frustration when it actually means task completion. Context reveals the difference.

## The Problem with Full Conversations or Documents

If single elements lack context, why not just process entire conversations or documents? Because even the largest language models have limits:

**Token Limits** LLMs have finite context windows. A lengthy email thread, a multi-hundred-page document, or months of chat history simply won't fit - even in models with large context windows.

**Signal Dilution** When you include everything, the relevant information gets buried. The critical context for understanding one message might be 3 exchanges back, not spread across 500 messages.

**Processing Costs** Larger inputs mean higher latency and compute costs. Processing entire documents for every query is inefficient and expensive at scale.

**Accuracy Degradation** Research shows that LLM accuracy decreases as context length increases. Important details in the middle of long inputs are often missed or weighted incorrectly.

## Examples

**Conversational Data (Support Chat)**

```
Customer: I placed an order yesterday
Agent: I can see order #4521 for the Pro subscription. How can I help?
Customer: I need to cancel it
```

Without context, "I need to cancel it" is ambiguous. With context, Flexor knows "it" refers to order #4521 for the Pro subscription.

**Documents**

```
Section 1: This agreement covers Services as defined in Exhibit A
...
Section 7: Termination of Services requires 30-day notice
```

Without context, "Services" in Section 7 is generic. With context, Flexor knows it refers to the specific services defined in Exhibit A.
