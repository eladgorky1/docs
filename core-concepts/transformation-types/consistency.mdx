title: "Consistency"

Consistency means Flexor delivers the same answer every time - across queries, functions, and transformation types.

## Overview

When you query your data with Flexor, you need to trust that the answer is reliable and repeatable. Running the same query twice should return the same result. A column created with FLEX_CREATE should match what you validated with FLEX. And related transformations should align logically - if nothing was extracted, no category should be assigned.

Flexor ensures consistency at every level, so you can build reports, dashboards, and workflows with confidence.

## Why Consistency Matters

Inconsistent AI outputs create serious problems:

- **Unreliable reporting** — Results change between runs, eroding trust in your data
- **Failed validation** — What you tested in development doesn't match production
- **Contradictory results** — One transformation says "yes" while a related one says "no"
- **Wasted time** — Teams spend hours investigating discrepancies instead of acting on insights

Consistency eliminates these issues. When Flexor gives you an answer, you can count on it.

## Consistency Across Queries

Run the same input on the same data point, get the same answer—every time.

| First Query                                          | Second Query               | Result        |
| :--------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------- | :------------ |
| "Did the customer request a refund?" on Message #123 | Same query on Message #123 | ✓ Same answer |

## Consistency Across Functions

Results from FLEX match results from FLEX_CREATE.

When you explore your data with FLEX and then deploy a persistent column with FLEX_CREATE, the outputs align. What you validated during testing is exactly what runs in production.

| FLEX (Ad-hoc)               | FLEX_CREATE (Persistent)    | Result       |
| :-------------------------- | :-------------------------- | :----------- |
| Classification: `True`      | Classification: `True`      | ✓ Consistent |
| Extraction: `["Product A"]` | Extraction: `["Product A"]` | ✓ Consistent |

No surprises when you move from exploration to deployment.

## Consistency Across Transformations

Related transformations produce logically aligned results.

Flexor ensures that classification, extraction, coupled-extraction, and categories work together coherently.
