title: "Coupled-Extraction"
---

## Overview

Use Coupled-Extraction when you need to extract multiple values that are semantically related to each other. Unlike standard Extraction, which returns separate arrays for each entity, Coupled-Extraction ensures that all values within each extraction are grouped together.

Coupled-Extraction combines the following components:

1. **Boolean context.** A True/False question that defines when extraction should occur.
2. **Multiple extraction targets.** A list of related values to extract together, each with a named identifier.

## Output

Coupled-Extraction returns the following properties:

| Property   | Description                                                                                                                         |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `answer`   | Each object contains the named extraction fields as key-value pairs. Returns `"NA"` if the boolean is False or no values are found. |
| `evidence` | Raw, unaltered evidence strings for each coupled extraction, in the same order and structure as the answer.                         |
| `viewer`   | A direct link to the full text with relevant evidence highlighted.                                                                  |

### Answer format

The `answer` property returns a JSON array where each item is an object containing the related extracted values:

```json
[
  {
    "product": "Laptop",
    "complaint": "The screen is completely cracked"
  },
  {
    "product": "Wireless mouse",
    "complaint": "won't connect to bluetooth anymore"
  }
]
```

### Evidence format

The `evidence` property mirrors the structure of the answer with raw text snippets:

```json
[
  {
    "product": "my laptop",
    "complaint": "The screen is completely cracked"
  },
  {
    "product": "Wireless mouse",
    "complaint": "won't connect to bluetooth anymore"
  }
]
```

### Normalization

Extracted values are automatically normalized to handle:

- Typos and misspellings
- Capitalization differences
- Common variations in how the same entity is expressed
