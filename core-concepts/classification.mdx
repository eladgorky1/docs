Boolean Classification evaluates text against a True/False question or statement and returns a Boolean answer with supporting evidence.

## Overview

Use Boolean Classification to classify unstructured data by asking questions or statements that can be answered with True or False. Flexor analyzes each record and determines whether the condition in your question is met.

Example questions:

- "Did the customer ask to return the product?"
- "Does the invoice specify the total amount?"
- "The agent offered a discount"
