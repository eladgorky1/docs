title: "FLEX_CREATE - Coupled-Extraction"
---

For conceptual information about Coupled-Extraction, see [Coupled-Extraction](https://flexor.mintlify.app/core-concepts/coupled-extraction).

## Overview

`FLEX_CREATE` creates a persistent column in your table and activates a recurring pipeline that automatically processes new rows. Unlike `FLEX`, which runs ad-hoc queries, `FLEX_CREATE` stores results and incrementally updates them as new data arrives.

## Syntax

```sql
FLEX_CREATE('<classification_input> -> <extraction_1> AS <name_1>, <extraction_2> AS <name_2>, ...', '<column_name>', '<table_name>');
```

## Parameters

| Parameter                  | Description                                                          |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `coupled_extraction_input` | A classification input followed by multiple extraction inputs        |
| `column_name`              | The name of the column to create in the output table.                |
| `table_name`               | The table within the Flexor schema to execute the transformation on. |

## Output columns

When you run `FLEX_CREATE` with a coupled-extraction input, the following columns are created:

| Column                   | Type  | Description                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------ | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<column_name>`          | Array | An array of objects containing the named extraction fields. Contains `["NA"]` if the boolean is False or no values are found. Contains `[""]` if not yet processed. |
| `<column_name>_evidence` | Array | An array of objects with raw text snippets for each coupled extraction.                                                                                             |

## Example

The following example creates a persistent column to extract products and their complaints:

```sql
SELECT
    FLEX_CREATE(
        'Did the customer complain about a product? -> product AS product, customer complaint AS complaint',
        'product_complaints',
        '<table_name>'
    );
```

This creates two columns in your output table:

- `product_complaints` — Array of objects with `product` and `complaint` keys.
- `product_complaints_evidence` — Array of objects with supporting evidence.
