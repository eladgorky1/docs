## Overview

Use Categories to map extracted values to a set of predefined categories. Categories builds on Extraction by taking extracted values and classifying them into groups you specify.

Categories combine the following components:

1. **Boolean context.** A True/False question that defines when categorization should occur.
2. **Extraction target.** The entity to extract and categorize.
3. **Category list.** A predefined list of up to 10 categories to classify the extracted values into.

The context from the Boolean question and extraction target influences which category is selected for each row.

## Output

Categories return the following properties:

| Property   | Description                                                                                                   |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `answer`   | The relevant categories inferred from the text. Returns `"NA"` if the boolean is False or no entity is found. |
| `evidence` | Raw text snippets that support the category assignment, in the same order as the categories.                  |
| `viewer`   | A direct link to the full text with relevant evidence highlighted.                                            |

### The "Other" category

When the boolean condition is True and an entity is extracted, but no suitable category is found in your predefined list, the system assigns `"Other"` as the category. This ensures data completeness and helps you identify gaps in your category list.

## Best practices

When designing your category list, consider the following:

- **Make categories mutually exclusive.** Design categories that don't overlap significantly.
- **Be collectively exhaustive.** Cover the main scenarios you expect to encounter.
- **Use clear definitions.** Choose unambiguous category names.
- **Choose appropriate granularity.** Avoid categories that are too broad (loses meaning) or too narrow (too many "Other" results).
- **Limit to 10 categories.** Keep your category list focused and manageable.
