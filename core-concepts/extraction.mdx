title: "Extraction"

## Overview

Use Extraction to retrieve specific information from your unstructured data. Extraction combines two components:

1. **Boolean Input.** A True/False question that defines when extraction should occur.
2. **Extraction Input.** The entity or value to extract from rows where the boolean condition is True.

The Boolean question provides context that influences what gets extracted. For example, asking "Is the customer interested in buying a product?" followed by extracting "which product?" returns only products the customer wants to buy - not products they're complaining about.

## Output

Extraction returns the following properties:

| Property   | Description                                                                                     |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `answer`   | Normalized extracted values. Returns `"NA"` if the boolean is False or no entity is found.      |
| `evidence` | Raw, unaltered text snippets corresponding to each extraction, in the same order as the answer. |
| `viewer`   | A direct link to the full text with relevant evidence highlighted.                              |

### Normalization

Extracted values are automatically normalized to handle:

- Typos and misspellings
- Capitalization differences
- Common variations in how the same entity is expressed
