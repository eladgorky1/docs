title: "Evidence"

Every Flexor transformation returns an `evidence` property alongside the `answer`. Evidence contains the exact text snippets from the original text that justify the result.

<u>Evidence</u> enables explainability - a core Flexor principle. Instead of black-box outputs, you can trace every answer back to the specific words in your data that led to that conclusion.

## Why Evidence Matters

**Auditability** Trace any insight back to its source. When a report or dashboard shows a number, you can trace exactly which messages contributed to that figure—and why.

**Trust** Build confidence in AI outputs by showing the work. Stakeholders can validate that outputs are based on real content, not hallucinations.

**Debugging** When results seem wrong, evidence reveals why. If the output doesn't match your intent, the evidence shows what text triggered that decision—helping you refine your input.

**Compliance** Meet governance requirements by maintaining complete lineage from raw data to structured output. Every transformation is explainable and auditable.

## How Evidence Works

When multiple values are returned for a single record (extractions, coupled-extractions, or categories), evidence appears in the same order as the answers, enabling direct matching between results and their source text.

## Output Format

Evidence format varies by transformation type:

**Classification**

```json
{
  "answer": "True",
  "evidence": "I need to return this laptop, it's not working properly"
}
```

**Extraction**

```json
{
  "answer": ["MacBook Pro", "iPhone 15"],
  "evidence": ["return this macbook pro", "also my iphone 15 has issues"]
}
```

**Coupled-Extraction**

```json
{
  "answer": [
    {"product": "MacBook Pro", "complaint": "screen flickering"},
    {"product": "iPhone 15", "complaint": "battery draining"}
  ],
  "evidence": [
    {"product": "macbook pro", "complaint": "the screen keeps flickering"},
    {"product": "iphone 15", "complaint": "battery drains within 2 hours"}
  ]
}
```

**Categories**

```json
{
  "answer": ["Discount Request", "Return Request"],
  "evidence": ["I want a discount", "I need to return this"]
}
```
