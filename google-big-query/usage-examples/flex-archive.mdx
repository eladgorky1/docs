# Use FLEX_ARCHIVE with BigQuery

This page describes how to use the `FLEX_ARCHIVE` function in BigQuery to remove persistent columns and disable their recurring pipelines.

## Example

### Archive a column

```sql
SELECT `my_project.my_dataset`.FLEX_ARCHIVE("refund_request", "support_tickets");
```

This removes both columns from your output table:

* `refund_request`
* `refund_request_evidence`
